# Chemoinformatics Database Generation

## Introduction

The Chemoinformatics Database Generation project offers a powerful tool for generating a chemoinformatics database from a genomic-scale model. By leveraging metabolite identifiers found in GEMs (Genome-scale Metabolic Models), this project enables the retrieval of molecular structures for metabolites from various databases or in different formats (e.g., MOL, RXN, SMILES, InChI, RInChI and InChIKey). 

## Features

- **Metabolite Identification:** Obtain molecular structures for metabolites.
- **Structural Comparison:** Compare molecular structures based on their InChI representation.
- **In-Depth Comparison:** Includes chemical formula, charge, stereochemistry, and similarity with other databases.
- **Standardization:** Check if the correct pH.

## Usage

1. **Metabolite Retrieval:** Using metabolite identifiers from GEMs, retrieve molecular structures from databases.

2. **Structural Comparison:** Compare retrieved structures to find the most suitable one for your genomic-scale model.

3. **Reaction Generation:** Generate atomically balanced reactions along with files in RXN, RInChI, and SMILES formats.

## Getting Started

You can also find scripts and functions related to this project in the [COBRA Toolbox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox). For a detailed guide on using these functions, please refer to the [COBRA Toolbox Documentation](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/blob/master/docs/source/notes/COBRAModelFields.md).

## Applications

- **Atom Transition Networks at Genome Scale:** Understand atomic transitions in a genomic context.
- **Identification of Conserved Moieties:** Discover conserved biochemical substructures.
- **Fluxomics Experiment Design:** Design experiments to analyze cellular fluxes.
- **Functional Objective Design:** Develop functional objectives for metabolic models.
- **Identification of Enthalpy and Bond Changes:** Investigate thermodynamic properties at a genomic scale.
