# COBRA Toolbox - XomicsToModel

## Introduction

The **XomicsToModel** function is a powerful tool within the COBRA Toolbox designed to bridge the gap between multi-omics data and genome-scale metabolic models. This function serves as a transformative bridge, allowing researchers to translate various omics datasets, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and literature-based "bibliomics," into context-specific metabolic models for particular cell types or conditions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Omics Integration:** XomicsToModel seamlessly integrates diverse omics data types, including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and bibliomics, to derive context-specific metabolic models.

- **Contextualization:** It generates metabolic models tailored to specific cell types or conditions, providing insights into the metabolic behaviors that are relevant to the given context.

- **Flexible Input:** Accepts a generic COBRA model and context-specific omics data as input, making it adaptable to a wide range of research scenarios.

- **Parameter Customization:** Offers a variety of parameters for fine-tuning the model generation process, allowing researchers to control and optimize their analyses.

## How to Use

To utilize the XomicsToModel function, follow these simple steps:

```matlab
[model, modelGenerationReport] = XomicsToModel(genericModel, specificData, param);
```

Where:
- `genericModel`: A generic COBRA model.
- `specificData`: A structure containing context-specific omics data.
- `param`: A structure containing various parameters for customization.
